    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze viewer engagement and behavioral patterns from the `viewer_interactions.db` dataset. As per the \"Audience Decode\" brief, our goal is not to predict individual ratings, but to explore and model audience behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use **Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)** to achieve this, focusing on:\n",
    "1.  **User Segmentation:** Identifying distinct groups of users based on their rating behaviors (e.g., \"Critical Power Users\", \"Casual Viewers\").\n",
    "2.  **Behavioral Analysis:** Understanding how these groups interact with different types of content and how preferences may evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on \"Genre\":** The project description mentions \"genres,\" but this information is not provided in database. We made our definition of content types(pseudo-denres) based on features given in movie data to proceed with analysis. \n",

    "\n",
    "Before running Birch, the user feature matrix was adjusted so that the clustering focuses more on how users behave, not only how much they watch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What was done**\n",
    "- `total_ratings` and `unique_movies` were downscaled (×0.5)\n",
    "  → these numbers are very large and would dominate the clustering.\n",
    "- `avg_rating`, `std_rating`, and `activity_days` were upscaled (×2.0)\n",
    "  → these better describe the user’s rating behavior and engagement style.\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a new matrix (`X_birch`) where behavioral features have more influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why this was needed**\n",
    "Without weighting:\n",
    "- Birch mainly separates light vs. heavy users.\n",
    "- Behavioral differences disappear because volume features are too strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "With weighting:\n",
    "- Clusters reflect actual behavior patterns, not just activity level.\n",
    "- We get more useful groups (e.g., explorers, consistent raters, heavy users, casual viewers).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Comparison**\n",
    "- **Unweighted Birch** mainly formed clusters based on activity volume (light, medium, heavy users).\n",
    "  Behavioral differences were blended together, resulting in less interpretable segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Behavior-weighted Birch** produced richer and more distinct behavioral profiles, enabling clusters such as:\n",

    "To create a complete profile of each audience segment, we combine:\n",
    "- **User behavioural features** from clustering (ratings, volume, activity span, exploration)\n",
    "- **Movie consumption patterns** (engagement shares by movie type)\n",
    "- **Taste preferences** (average ratings by movie type)\n",
    "\n",
    "This integration produces rich and realistic audience personas.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **One-time Fan Visitors (Cluster 0)**  \n",
    "**User behaviour:**  \n",
    "- Extremely light users (**2–3 total ratings**) with **almost no activity span**  \n",
    "- **Very generous raters (~4.5 avg)** despite minimal exploration  \n",
    "- Rate a couple of films during a single visit and disappear  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Movie preferences:**  \n",
    "- **58% Blockbuster Hits**, **32% Well-Liked Movies**  \n",
    "- Minimal attention to Classics, Niche Films, or Controversial titles  \n",
    "- High ratings for *every* category, including niche and controversial titles (**4.4–4.6**)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**  \n",
    "These are impulse-driven visitors who arrive, watch the big trending titles, and leave immediately.  \n",
    "They do not explore deeply, but they rate optimistically and positively.  \n",
    "Their behaviour suggests social hype or platform curiosity rather than sustained engagement.\n",

    "- Ratings reveal mild dissatisfaction with Niche and Controversial categories (**2.9–2.8**)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**  \n",

    "**Interpretation:**  \n",
    "This is a behaviourally unique cluster: users appear briefly, often search for a specific film, rate it harshly, and leave.  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Hated Niche Films**\n",
    "- Surprisingly high early share (~35–44%), then a steep decline after 1999.\n",
    "- **Interpretation:** The early years saw a large proportion of niche content being rated (possibly due to database structure), but user attention shifts away afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Old Classics**\n",
    "- Stable in early years (~10–18%), then decline through the 2000s.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Blockbuster Hits**\n",
    "- Dramatic rise starting around 1999–2001, overtaking other genres.\n",
    "- **Interpretation:** As the platform matures, mainstream blockbusters become the primary driver of ratings and traffic.\n",

    "## 8. Conclusions & Strategic Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "The deep-dive analysis reveals a coherent structure within both the audience and the content ecosystem, showing how long-term engagement, content preferences, and rating behaviour intertwine. Several user groups emerge as central to the platform’s sustained success, while others reflect short-lived or highly specific usage patterns. Together, these insights provide a clear strategic direction for content curation, recommendation systems, and audience development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Core Audience Dynamics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all years and behavioural indicators, three segments consistently demonstrate long-term value: **Consistent Enjoyers**, **Loyal Occasional Enjoyers**, and **Heavy Enthusiasts**. These groups combine meaningful activity spans with stable viewing and rating patterns, forming the backbone of audience retention. They interact positively with a range of content, especially high-quality mainstream films and, in the case of Enthusiasts, classics and niche titles as well.  \n",
    "Conversely, segments such as **One-time Fan Visitors** and **Short-Term Users** generate substantial rating volume but little ongoing engagement, indicating that they are driven by momentary interest rather than platform loyalty. **One-Movie Critics**, while behaviourally distinct, contribute minimal long-term value and tend to give disproportionately negative ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Content Patterns and Their Implications**\n",
    "\n",
    "The content landscape shows a strong gravitational pull toward **Blockbuster Hits** and **Well-Liked Movies**, which consistently attract the majority of ratings across all user types. These clusters not only maintain their dominance over time but become even more central in later years, confirming their importance as engagement drivers.  \n",
    "Other categories play more specialized roles: **Old Classics** retain a small but steady audience, while **Hated Niche Films** and **Controversial Titles** lose visibility and appeal as the platform grows. **Unnoticed Films** remain peripheral throughout. These patterns suggest that mainstream content will continue to anchor the platform, with Classics serving as valuable differentiation for loyal, high-engagement users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Temporal Evolution**\n",
    "\n",
    "The temporal analysis highlights a notable shift around the early 2000s: **Loyal Occasional Enjoyers** briefly dominate the audience mix, reflecting a surge of long-term but low-volume users. Over time, **Heavy Enthusiasts** gain prominence, signalling the emergence of a stable cinephile segment that relies increasingly on deeper catalog exploration. Meanwhile, short-lived clusters decline, pointing to an overall maturation of the audience base.  \n",
    "Content trends mirror this evolution: Blockbusters and high-quality mainstream titles rise in prominence, while niche and controversial genres diminish. The alignment between audience evolution and content dynamics indicates that the platform is moving toward more sustained and predictable engagement patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Strategic Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings collectively suggest a dual strategic focus. First, strengthen and retain the platform’s core audience by offering tailored recommendations: mainstream-first lists for casual users, balanced and quality-driven sets for Enjoyers, and deeper exploratory pathways for Enthusiasts. Second, ensure that the content catalog highlights the categories that drive engagement—Blockbuster Hits and Well-Liked Movies—while leveraging Classics to differentiate and serve long-term users.  \n",
    "At the same time, onboarding flows should nudge One-time Visitors toward more content after their initial blockbuster interaction, increasing the likelihood of converting them into long-term segments. Finally, recommendation systems should avoid giving polarizing niche content to rating-sensitive groups, reducing dissatisfaction and rating volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Takeaway**\n",
    "\n",
    "The platform’s sustained growth depends on understanding and nurturing the segments that consistently return, explore, and evaluate movies positively. By aligning content strategy and recommendations with the behavioural strengths of each user group, the platform can enhance satisfaction, improve retention, and create a viewing experience that evolves alongside its audience."

Niche and controversial films attract only small, polarized groups and decline over time.
