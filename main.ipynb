    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze viewer engagement and behavioral patterns from the `viewer_interactions.db` dataset. As per the \"Audience Decode\" brief, our goal is not to predict individual ratings, but to explore and model audience behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use **Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)** to achieve this, focusing on:\n",
    "1.  **User Segmentation:** Identifying distinct groups of users based on their rating behaviors (e.g., \"Critical Power Users\", \"Casual Viewers\").\n",
    "2.  **Behavioral Analysis:** Understanding how these groups interact with different types of content and how preferences may evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on \"Genre\":** The project description mentions \"genres,\" but this information is not provided in database. We made our definition of content types(pseudo-genres) based on features given in movie data to proceed with analysis.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **What was done**\n",
    "- `total_ratings` and `unique_movies` were downscaled (×0.5)\n",
    "  → these numbers are very large and would dominate the clustering.\n",
    "- `avg_rating`, `std_rating`, and `activity_days` were upscaled (×2.0)\n",
    "  → these better describe the user’s rating behavior and engagement style.\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a new matrix (`X_birch`) where behavioral features have more influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why this was needed**\n",
    "Without weighting:\n",
    "- Birch mainly separates light vs. heavy users.\n",
    "- Behavioral differences disappear because volume features are too strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "With weighting:\n",
    "- Clusters reflect actual behavior patterns, not just activity level.\n",
    "- We get more useful groups (e.g., explorers, consistent raters, heavy users, casual viewers).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Comparison**\n",
    "- **Unweighted Birch** mainly formed clusters based on activity volume (light, medium, heavy users).\n",
    "  Behavioral differences were blended together, resulting in less interpretable segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Behavior-weighted Birch** produced richer and more distinct behavioral profiles, enabling clusters such as:\n",

    "### What Each User Segment Watches?\n",
    "\n",
    "We combine user behavioural traits (volume, activity span, rating style) with movie-cluster taste preferences (engagement shares and average ratings) to form clear audience personas.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Consistent Enjoyers (Cluster 0)**\n",
    "**Behaviour:** Moderate–high activity, broad exploration, stable positive ratings.\n",
    "**Viewing:** Mostly **Popular Films (43%)** and **Blockbusters (30%)**; some **Controversial Films (19%)**.\n",
    "**Taste:** Strong ratings for well-liked and mainstream titles (≈3.7–3.8).\n",
    "**Insight:** A reliable, satisfied core audience focused on mainstream content.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Fan Visitors (Cluster 1)**\n",
    "**Behaviour:** Minimal activity, extremely generous rating style.\n",
    "**Viewing:** Primarily **Blockbusters (52%)**, then **Popular Films (28%)**.\n",
    "**Taste:** Highest ratings across all clusters (4.4+).\n",
    "**Insight:** One-session users drawn to trending films; high positivity without retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **One-Movie Critics (Cluster 2)**\n",
    "**Behaviour:** Very low activity, harsh rating patterns.\n",
    "**Viewing:** **Blockbusters (47%)**, **Popular Films (20%)**, notable **Controversial Films (18%)**; only group engaging with **Invisible Films (6%)**.\n",
    "**Taste:** Lowest ratings in all categories (1.5–2.6).\n",
    "**Insight:** Critical visitors who explore unusual content but rarely enjoy it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Loyal Occasional Enjoyers (Cluster 3)**\n",
    "**Behaviour:** Light but long-term activity (multi-year), steady positive ratings.\n",
    "**Viewing:** Split between **Popular Films (38%)** and **Blockbusters (36%)**.\n",
    "**Taste:** Consistently positive for mainstream content (≈3.5–3.7).\n",
    "**Insight:** Rarely active but highly loyal mainstream viewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Heavy Enthusiasts (Cluster 4)**\n",
    "**Behaviour:** Highest engagement, broad exploration, moderate–positive ratings.\n",
    "**Viewing:** More diverse: **Controversial Films (34%)**, **Popular Films (37%)**, **Classics (8%)**, fewer Blockbusters.\n",
    "**Taste:** Appreciates niche and older films (≈3.4–3.5); realistic scoring.\n",
    "**Insight:** Deep catalog explorers who enrich platform depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Short-Term Users (Cluster 5)**\n",
    "**Behaviour:** Light–moderate short-term activity, neutral ratings.\n",
    "**Viewing:** **Blockbusters (48%)** and **Popular Films (34%)** dominate.\n",
    "**Taste:** Good ratings for mainstream (≈3.6), much lower for fringe categories.\n",
    "**Insight:** Trial-phase users who watch promoted films but rarely stay.\n",

    "\n",
    "### How Each User Segment Rates Content (pref_mean)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fan Visitors** inflate all ratings (4.4+).\n",
    "- **Consistent Enjoyers**, **Loyal Occasional**, and **Heavy Enthusiasts** form the realistic positive-rating base (3.4–3.8).\n",
    "- **Short-Term Users** resemble Enjoyers but drop sharply on niche content.\n",
    "- **One-Movie Critics** rate all clusters poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insight:** Rating style alone already separates long-term stable users from temporary or dissatisfied ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temporal Behavior of User Segments\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1999–2001:** *Loyal Occasional Enjoyers* temporarily dominate rating activity.\n",
    "- **Post-2001:** *Consistent Enjoyers* and *Heavy Enthusiasts* rise steadily and become the key long-term segments.\n",
    "- *Fan Visitors* and *Short-Term Users* decline over time.\n",
    "- *One-Movie Critics* remain small and stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insight:** Over time, the audience shifts toward more stable and engaged user groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temporal Behavior of Movie Clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Popular Films** surge after 1999 and stay dominant.\n",
    "- **Blockbusters** rise sharply after 2000.\n",
    "- **Niche and Invisible Films** steadily decline.\n",
    "- **Old Classics** remain marginal but persistent.\n",
    "- **Controversial Films** stay mid-tier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insight:** The platform matures toward mainstream consumption, with niche categories losing influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combined Insights: Which Segments Match Which Genres?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistent Enjoyers → Popular Films & Blockbusters**\n",
    "- **Fan Visitors → Blockbusters & Popular Films**\n",
    "- **Loyal Occasional Enjoyers → Popular Films & Blockbusters**\n",
    "- **Heavy Enthusiasts → Controversial Films & Classics**\n",
    "- **One-Movie Critics → Controversial & Invisible Films**\n",
    "- **Short-Term Users → Blockbusters & Popular Films**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mainstream clusters (Blockbusters, Popular Films) dominate almost all user groups.\n",
    "- Niche, controversial, and invisible films appeal mainly to Enthusiasts or Critics.\n",
    "- Engagement patterns clearly differentiate long-term valuable users from short-term ones.\n",
    "- **Consistent Enjoyers, Loyal Occasional Enjoyers, and Heavy Enthusiasts** emerge as the platform’s most strategic segments.\n",
    "- The ecosystem shifts over time toward mainstream, high-engagement content.\n",
    "\n",
    "These combined behavioural, preference, and temporal patterns provide a full decoding of the platform’s audience and the content that sustains it."

    "## SECTION 8: CONCLUSIONS\n",
    "This project reveals a clear and interpretable structure behind how audiences behave and how content performs on the platform. By combining behavioural clustering, consumption patterns, rating preferences, and temporal analysis, we uncover which users matter most, which films drive engagement, and how both evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Audience Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Three user groups consistently shape long-term platform value: **Consistent Enjoyers**, **Loyal Occasional Enjoyers**, and **Heavy Enthusiasts**.\n",
    "They return regularly, rate positively, explore meaningfully, and anchor overall retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Short-lived groups—**Fan Visitors** and **Short-Term Users**—generate high initial volume but do not convert into lasting engagement.\n",
    "**One-Movie Critics**, while behaviourally unique, add little strategic value due to minimal activity and strongly negative ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content Landscape\n",
    "\n",
    "Engagement centres overwhelmingly on **Blockbusters** and **Popular Films**, which dominate viewing regardless of user type.\n",
    "**Well-Liked Niche Films** receive high ratings from nearly everyone but attract small audiences.\n",
    "**Old Classics** maintain a steady but narrow appeal, while **Controversial Films** sharply divide viewers.\n",
    "**Hated Invisible Films** hold no engagement potential and are consistently rated poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Behaviour Changes Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "User composition shifts notably around the early 2000s, when **Loyal Occasional Enjoyers** briefly dominate before giving way to rising **Heavy Enthusiasts** and growing **Consistent Enjoyers**.\n",
    "Content trends follow suit: the platform becomes increasingly mainstream-driven, with Popular Films and Blockbusters absorbing most attention across later years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategic Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "To support sustainable growth:\n",
    "- Prioritise **mainstream-first recommendations** for casual users.\n",
    "- Provide **balanced, quality-driven suggestions** for Enjoyers.\n",
    "- Offer **deep catalogue pathways** for Enthusiasts, who drive long-term depth and ratings.\n",
    "- Avoid overly niche or polarizing titles for rating-sensitive segments.\n",
    "- Use onboarding flows to convert one-time visitors before they churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Across the entire work—from data preprocessing to clustering, preference modelling, and temporal analysis—the findings converge on a simple conclusion:\n",
    "**engagement and retention are driven by a stable core of positive, long-term users and by a content ecosystem dominated by reliable mainstream films.**\n",
    "Aligning recommendation strategies with these behavioural patterns gives the platform its clearest path toward stronger satisfaction, higher retention, and a more resilient audience base."
